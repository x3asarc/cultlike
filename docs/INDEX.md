## 📝 Example: What a Feature File Looks Like

```markdown
# Feature: Quiz Flow (Location → Month → Type Selection)

## What It Does
Users click through 3 steps to find events:
1. Select location (floating fonts sized by event count)
2. Select month (shows only months with events)
3. Select event type (shows only types with events)
4. See filtered event results

## Why Phase 1
This is the core UX. Users can't find events without it.

## Dependencies
- Database: `locations`, `event_types`, `months`, `events` tables
- State: Zustand `useQuizStore`
- Components: `LocationStep`, `MonthStep`, `TypeStep`
- API: GET `/api/events` to fetch by filter

## How It Works
1. Load /quiz page
2. Query locations, render floating fonts (sized by event_count)
3. User clicks location → store in Zustand
4. Query months WHERE location_id = selected, render grid
5. User clicks month → store in Zustand
6. Query types WHERE location_id = selected AND month = selected
7. User clicks type → navigate to /events?location=...&month=...&type=...
8. /events page fetches matching events, renders grid

## API Contracts
```
GET /api/events?location=loc_001&month=3&type=type_001&radius=5

Response:
{
  events: [
    {
      id, title, date, price, venue: { name, lat, long },
      reviews_count, avg_rating
    }
  ],
  total: 25
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Floating fonts render
- [ ] Sizes match event counts
- [ ] Click location → filters months
- [ ] Months show zero-count months as disabled
- [ ] Click month → filters types
- [ ] Results page shows correct events
- [ ] Radius filter works (filters by distance)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter)

## Common Pitfalls
- Querying all events then filtering client-side (slow!)
  → Query in DB instead
- Showing all months even if location has 0 events
  → Filter to months_with_events only
- Not storing location/month in state
  → Next page won't know what user selected
```

## Quick Scaffold Command

Copy this into your terminal to create all empty files:

```bash
# Create .docs/ structure
mkdir -p .docs/{architecture,database,integrations,setup,features,patterns,review}
mkdir -p .claude-prompts
mkdir -p scripts

# Create empty files with headers
# (You'll add content as you build)

touch .docs/architecture/{components,routing,data-flow}.md
touch .docs/database/{schema,migrations,seed}.md
touch .docs/integrations/{NEXTJS,VERCEL,STRIPE,EVENTBRITE_API,RESEND,LEAFLET}.md
touch .docs/setup/{environment,database-setup,seeding}.md
touch .docs/features/{01_quiz-flow,02_event-listing,03_event-detail,04_user-auth,05_reviews,06_venue-dashboard,07_blog-templates,FEATURE_FLAGS}.md
touch .docs/patterns/{error-handling,logging,accessibility,performance,state-management,api-calls,forms}.md
touch .docs/review/PERFORMANCE.md
touch .claude-prompts/{new-page,new-feature,database-change,debug-issue,generate-seed,component-from-figma,optimize-query}.md
```

## How to Use This Index

1. **Read MASTER_PROMPT.md first** — It's your north star
2. **Scaffold all files** — Use command above
3. **Build one feature** — Read relevant feature doc
4. **Reference integration docs** — When using Supabase, Vercel, etc.
5. **Log your session** — Update SESSION_LOG.md
6. **Update docs as you build** — Keep them current

Each file is a tool. Use it when you need it.

---

## What Gets Updated Often

- `.docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — After every session
- `.docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md` — Project status section
- `.docs/features/*` — As you build each feature
- `.docs/database/schema.md` — When adding tables/columns

## What Gets Updated Rarely

- `.docs/architecture/*` — Set once, reference often
- `.docs/integrations/*` — Usually final form
- `.docs/setup/*` — Rarely changes after setup
- `.docs/patterns/*` — Established early

---

## Next Steps

1. Copy scaffold command above
2. Run it in terminal
3. Read `.docs/setup/local-dev.md`
4. Get local dev working
5. Read `MASTER_PROMPT.md`
6. Start building with Claude Code
7. Update docs as you go
